# ansible-pimatic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/layereight/ansible-pimatic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/layereight/ansible-pimatic)

An Ansible role to install and configure [pimatic](https://pimatic.org) - a smart home automation software for the
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

## Requirements

* Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS
* network access to the Raspberry Pi and [sshd enabled](https://layereight.de/raspberry-pi/2017/02/28/ssh-headless-Raspberry-Pi.html)
* a user with sudo permissions

## Install the role via Ansible Galaxy

Typical run:
```sh
$ ansible-galaxy install layereight.pimatic
```

If you want to install a specific version in a collection with other roles using a role file:
```sh
$ ansible-galaxy install -r roles.yml
```
*roles.yml*
```YAML
- name: layereight.pimatic
  src: layereight.pimatic
  version: "1.5"
```
* also see the [Ansible Galaxy documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/galaxy.html) and the 
[Ansible Galaxy introduction](https://galaxy.ansible.com/intro)

## Role Variables

### mandatory

* **pimatic_nodejs_arch:** Has to be set. Choose node.js hardware architecture, typically **armv6l** (Pi Model A, B, B+ or Zero) 
or **armv7l** (Pi 2 Model B or Pi 3 Model B).

### optional

* **pimatic_app_dir**
  * default: "pimatic-app"
  * description: Name of the directory in the user's home directory where pimatic should be installed to. E.g. with user `pi` the final
  installation directory will become `/home/pi/pimatic-app`.

* **pimatic_port**
  * default: 8080
  * description: Port pimatic's web frontend will listen on. We will also wait_for pimatic to start up on that port. You may want to set it
  to **443** when you enable **pimatic_ssl**.

* **pimatic_config_template**
  * default: "config.json.j2"
  * description: The role comes with pimatic's standard configuration. Pimatic's httpServer will be started on **pimatic_port**.
  Usually you want to provide your own pimatic configuration template. E.g. set **pimatic_config_template** to **pimatic_config.json.j2**
  and create a file of that name in the `templates` directory relative to your ansible playbook.

* **pimatic_waitfor_startup** 
  * default: true
  * description: Configure whether the role wait for pimatic to start up. Depending on the hardware we are running on and depending on the
  configured plugins this may take up to 1h.

* **pimatic_ssl** 
  * default: false
  * description: Configure whether we should generate self signed ssl certificates. If set to **true** the role will provide the variables
  **pimatic_ssl_privkey** and **pimatic_ssl_cert** with the paths to the generated ssl private key and certificate.

* **pimatic_ssl_cn**
  * default: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
  * description: Common Name in certificate (CN in subject).
  
* **pimatic_ssl_c**
  * default: "DE"
  * description: Country in certificate (C in subject).
  
* **pimatic_ssl_st**
  * default: ""
  * description: State in certificate (ST in subject).

* **pimatic_ssl_l**
  * default: ""
  * description: Location in certificate (L in subject).

* **pimatic_ssl_o** 
  * default: "pimatic"
  * description: Organization in certificate (O in subject).
  
* **pimatic_ssl_ou**
  * default: "pimatic"
  * description: Organizational Unit in certificate (OU in subject).


### provided

* **pimatic_ssl_privkey:** Provided if **pimatic_ssl** is set to **true**. You may want to use this variable in your 
**pimatic_config_template** to setup a `httpsServer`.

* **pimatic_ssl_cert:** Provided if **pimatic_ssl** is set to **true**. You may want to use this variable in your 
**pimatic_config_template** to setup a `httpsServer`.
